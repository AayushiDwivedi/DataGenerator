=============================

DataGenerator is a model-based tool for data generation designed to help testers quickly address changes to application requirements
and test coverage demands. The DataGenerator approach allows testers to capture scnearios in the form of equivalence classes and
a graphical state-machine model. These inputs drive the population of fully customizable, templatized text files (e.g., CSV, XML, input files, or
even source code!).

DataGenerator can be configured to provide various levels of coverage of models and equivalence classes. Templating leverages Apache Velocity, and
can be extended through the Velocity Java API.
